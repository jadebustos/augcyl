<p><h3>Notas:</h3><br>
A Firewall normally includes mechanisms for protection at the: <br>
<br>
    Network Layer: IP packets are sanitised (source routing disabled, only packets<br>
    with valid external addresses allowed), and routed according to predefined rules.<br>
    Some firewalls allow translation of internal IP addresses to valid Internet IP<br>
    addresses (NAT or Network Address Translation) and other replace all internal<br>
    addresses with the firewall address (meaning internal hosts cannot be addressed). <br>
    Transport Layer: Access to TCP &amp; UDP ports can be granted/blocked, depending<br>
    on IP address of both sender and receiver. This allows access control for many<br>
    TCP services, but doesn't work at all for others (e.g. X11, ftp, portmapper<br>
    services). <br>
    Application Layer: <br>
         Proxy servers (also called application gateways) accept requests for a<br>
        particular application and either further the request to the final destination, or<br>
        block the request. Ideally proxies should be transparent to the end user.<br>
        Proxies are stripped-down, reliable versions of standard applications with<br>
        access control and forwarding built-in. <br>
        Typical proxies include HTTP (for WWW), telnet, ftp etc. Certain applications<br>
        such as Internet Email (smtp) are designed for the use of relays or<br>
        forwarders. <br>
        The DNS application provides IP address to hostname (or vice versa) lookup.<br>
        DNS does not really check where information comes from, so it may be<br>
        possible for an attacker to spoof the DNS service into giving false information,<br>
        e.g. that the hostname of an attackers machine is that of a trusted host. <br>
        Applications such as rlogin and NFS use host-names for access control and<br>
        are hence vulnerable to DNS spoofing. <br>
        IP addresses should be used on proxy access control lists instead of DNS<br>
        names (to minimise the risk of DNS spoofing). But even IP addresses can be<br>
        spoofed if routers are not configured properly and switches are not used. <br>
