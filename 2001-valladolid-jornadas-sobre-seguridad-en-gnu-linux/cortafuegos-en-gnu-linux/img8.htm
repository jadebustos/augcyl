<p><h3>Notas:</h3><br>
1.Define goals: What services do you want? How much can it cost? Provide a<br>
    business justification for services. <br>
  2.Who/what are you trying to protect, from whom / against what (threats)? <br>
  3.What known weaknesses need to be addressed? <br>
  4.What risks (likelihood and consequences or impact) do the above threats entail? <br>
  5.Develop a strategy to counter the unacceptable threats: policy, organisation,<br>
    processes and specific technical mechanisms. <br>
  6.Select the appropriate technical solution: What tools can provide access to the<br>
    required services with the specified budget at an acceptable risk? Choose a stable<br>
    well known technical architecture, test the solution, install it securely. <br>
  7.Define a support organisation with roles, processes. You need a well organised<br>
    team to manage firewalls. Make sure that processes exist for handling a security<br>
    breach swiftly. Plan for an attack! <br>
  8.Submit the firewall to regular monitoring and independent audits.  <br>
  9.Running a Internet firewall is an endless operation, so it makes sense to follow the<br>
    technical and social evolution of the Internet. <br>
